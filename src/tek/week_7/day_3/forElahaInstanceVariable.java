	//Instance Variables 

	//Instance variables are those variables which is declared inside of the 
	//class but outside of the method, constructor or any block. Instane variables
	//are also called class scope variables they are also called Fields.

	//Instance variables have some characterstics:

	//1. The will be created when the object of the class is created. 

	//2. Instance variables have default values, for the numbers it is 0
	//for the reference it is null and for the boolean is is false. 
	// Reference variable means Sting 

	//3. The scope of instance variables are within the class -> and since
	//inside of the class we have different methods or no methods at all
	//still you can access the Instance variables.
